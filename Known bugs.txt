Things not fixed by the main SBPP files:

  humanoid\novakid\malebody.png
    Some pixels on a few frames do not color with the rest of the body.

  humanoid\apex\femalebody.png
    Feet are missing fur on one frame.

Things not fixed by SBPP:    
  Textures are not well optimised. PNGauntlet yields a lossles compression of 25% to 85% per texture.
  Improvements include reduced file size, less RAM usage, and less disk usage.
  
  Starbound has stuttering issues caused by disk read/write usage on my system if it is not installed on my SSD.
  One of my friends had excesive stuttering and his framerate was stuck at ~30 before moving it to his SSD.
  Most of it appears to be caused by write operations. Storing world and player saves that are being used in memory and writing at set intevals could help resolve this.
