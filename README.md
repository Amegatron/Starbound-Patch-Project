# Starbound-Patch-Project
A collection of patches and bug-fixes for Starbound

The type of things this aims to fix:

•	Spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors.

•	Sprites with missing or extra pixels
(e.g.: random out of place pixel, hole in a single frame of a clothing item)

•	LUA files with errors or incorrect values
(e.g.: boat.lua had both of those things)

•	Items with bad or inconsistent values 
(e.g.: inconsistent/missing prices, bad hand positioning, wrong food values)

This includes fixes for unobtainable items because so many people use commands or mods to get ahold of them.
