  "description" : "Welcone to Starbound Patch Project!\nThis project was made to fix bugs present in Starbound. Currently it fixes over 45 bugs.\n\nSupports Ztarbound in-game changelogs if that mod is present\n\nSome unobtainable items have fixes included. This is intentional. Many people spawn items in or have mods that allow them to get them.\nThis will not make unobtainable items obtainable, that is not the goal of the mod.\nPNGGauntlet has been used on all textures modified by SBPP to reduce file size and improve load times.\n\nStarbound Patch Project Github: https://github.com/jss2a98aj/Starbound-Patch-Project\n\nCredits:\nBug hunters: Clank8138\n\nPermissions: see https://github.com/jss2a98aj/Starbound-Patch-Project/blob/master/README.md",
