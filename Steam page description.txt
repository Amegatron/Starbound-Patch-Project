Recent Changelogs:
[code]
-------- 1.5.1 --------
Several more typos were fixed.

Some references to cut lore were removed thanks to Armok.

The Swansong fight hat timers added to some attacks so they would not get stuck thanks to Kherae.

Several more UI and menu issues were fixed thanks to Silver Sokolova.

Apex City building2clue now has the same loot table fix as its non-clue counterpart.

The Avian and human female body textures each had a miscolored border pixel corrected.

Reverted a fix to upgradeablecraftingobject.lua because it was not working correctly for everyone.
This fix is likely to return with better implementation later on.


-------- 1.5.0 --------
This update is effectively a total remake of the patch project from the ground up.
Every single change has been re-evaluated to ensure it is working as intended.

Dozens more creatures, including every netable insect, now have names and descriptions.
Farm animal descriptions even say what items they will produce.

A few monster drop pools have been correctly assigned.

Several more missing and placeholder inventory icons have been added or replaced.

Missing drop shadows, badly offset shine layers, and other UI issues have been fixed.

Several commands that were missing help documentation are now documented thanks to Silver Sokolova.

Items with a stack limit of 1000 (the max with no mods) have had it removed so stack size mods will apply to them.

Upgradable crafting stations that have not been placed but not upgraded no longer have extra data added when broken.
This allows them to stack with ones that have never been placed.

Almost every patch now uses test operations to ensure better compatibility.
The load priority has been set to be just after the base game for better compatibility.
Ztarbound/FU in-game changelog integration have been dropped so the new load priority can be used.
One upside is that the length of changelog entries no longer have to be constrained to fit the in-game changelog.
Please note that this changelog entry is not comprehensive due to the number of changes made.
However, the list of bugs fixed is no longer missing anything and is far more detailed than before.

PNGGauntlet has been used on all textures modified by SBPP to reduce file size and improve load times.
